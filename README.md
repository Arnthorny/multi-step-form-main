## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Vanilla JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - Plain Javascript

### What I learned

I learnt a few more ways to manipulate CSS classes and Pseudo-classes

```css
#next.confirm {
  background-color: var(--purplish-blue);
}

#next.confirm:hover {
  background-color: var(--purplish-blue-hover);
}
```

### Continued development

Plan to learn CSS Grid and practice more with the Flexbox.
